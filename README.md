## Question and Answering (Q&A) Experiment

### Objective
This experiment aims to evaluate NotebookLM's Question & Answer (Q&A) feature by testing its ability to answer specific academic questions based on uploaded course materials.

### Steps Taken
1. **Upload Document**: Uploaded course materials on Dialogflow CX into NotebookLM.
2. **Ask Question**: Asked the question: "How does a Dialogflow CX agent interact with data stores to retrieve information?"

### Results
NotebookLM generated a detailed response based on the content within the uploaded document, explaining how Dialogflow CX agents use API integrations and data retrieval protocols to interact with data stores. The answer included inline citations referencing specific sections of the document.
