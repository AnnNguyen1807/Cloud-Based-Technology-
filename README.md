# Experiment with NotebookLM

## Content Summarization

### Experiment
The goal of this experiment is to evaluate NotebookLM's content summarization feature by testing its ability to generate concise and accurate summaries from complex academic documents, specifically focusing on research papers related to cognitive psychology. After uploading a research paper into NotebookLM, NotebookLM automatically creates structured summaries with distinct sections for key findings, numerical data, and main arguments

### Results

### Key Observations:
- The summary effectively captured the main points of the document, including key theories and findings.
- The structured format made it easy to identify important sections such as key findings and numerical data.
- However, some nuanced details and complex theoretical discussions were oversimplified.

## Question and Answering (Q&A) 

### Experiment
The purpose of this experiment is to evaluate NotebookLM's Question & Answer (Q&A) feature by testing its ability to answer specific academic questions based on uploaded course materials. This feature aims to simulate an interactive, tutor-like experience for students. Firstly, uploadeding course materials on Dialogflow CX into NotebookLM.
Secondly, Asking the question: "How does a Dialogflow CX agent interact with data stores to retrieve information?"

## Results

 - NotebookLM generated a detailed response based on the content within the uploaded document, explaining how Dialogflow CX agents use API integrations and data retrieval protocols to interact with data stores. The generated answer included inline citations that referenced specific sections of the document, ensuring that the response was grounded in the provided source material.

### Key Observations:
- The Q&A feature provided accurate and contextually relevant answers for straightforward, factual questions.
- Inline citations enhanced academic integrity by allowing easy verification of the information.

## Content Analysis 

### Experiment
The goal of this experiment is to evaluate NotebookLM's Content Analysis feature by analyzing academic documents on AI in education to extract key topics, patterns, and insights that may not be immediately apparent. Prompted NotebookLM to analyze how Dialogflow CX agents interact with data stores. 

### Results

- The tool identified key concepts such as API integrations, data retrieval protocols, and entity matching from various documents provided and providing insights that help students connect theoretical knowledge to practical applications.
- Provide a synthesized list of insights and relevant questions based on the identified themes.

### Key Observations:
- The analysis effectively identified major themes across the documents, including AIâ€™s role in enhancing personalized learning.
- The tool provided relevant questions for further exploration, which could help guide research or project development.

## Learning Paths 

### Experiment
The objective of this experiment is to assess NotebookLM's custom learning path feature, which enables students to organize and format their study materials in ways that improve engagement and retention. In this experiment, we focus on generating a study guide from documents related to AI in education. The process began by selecting the "Study Guide" format from the preset options provided by NotebookLM.

### Results

- NotebookLM generated a structured study guide with clear sections for key points, including AI's role in personalized learning and ethical concerns. The content was presented in a way that facilitated easier understanding of complex topics.

### Key Observations:
- The study guide effectively summarized the main points, making it easy to review.
- The format was particularly helpful for breaking down complex topics into manageable sections.
  

## Audio Overview

### Objective
The goal of this experiment is to test NotebookLM's Audio Overview feature by generating an audio summary of cognitive psychology lecture notes, specifically focusing on theories of memory.

### Steps Taken

1. **Upload Document**: 
   - Uploaded lecture notes titled `BUS5001-Week11-DialogFlowCX-II.pdf` into NotebookLM.
   
2. **Select Audio Overview**:
   - Selected the "Generate Audio Overview" option from NotebookLM's interface.
   
3. **Customize Prompt**:
   - Customized the prompt to focus on "Explain the theories of memory" to generate a targeted audio summary on this topic.
   
4. **Audio Generation**:
   - NotebookLM generated a podcast-style audio summary that highlighted key theories such as short-term memory, long-term memory, and working memory.

5. **Listen and Review**:
   - Listened to the generated audio summary. The audio was clear and concise, covering essential points about memory theories.

### Results

The generated audio file can be accessed [here](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/12d1e3c7-16f0-46d8-a31d-62aa47b88317/audio).
