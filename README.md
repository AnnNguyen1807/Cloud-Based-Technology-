# Experiment with NotebookLM

## Content Summarization Experiment with NotebookLM

### Experiment
The goal of this experiment is to evaluate NotebookLM's content summarization feature by testing its ability to generate concise and accurate summaries from complex academic documents, specifically focusing on research papers related to cognitive psychology. After uploading a research paper into NotebookLM, NotebookLM automatically creates structured summaries with distinct sections for key findings, numerical data, and main arguments

### Results

### Key Observations:
- The summary effectively captured the main points of the document, including key theories and findings.
- The structured format made it easy to identify important sections such as key findings and numerical data.
- However, some nuanced details and complex theoretical discussions were oversimplified.

## Question and Answering (Q&A) 

### Experiment
The purpose of this experiment is to evaluate NotebookLM's Question & Answer (Q&A) feature by testing its ability to answer specific academic questions based on uploaded course materials. This feature aims to simulate an interactive, tutor-like experience for students. Firstly, uploadeding course materials on Dialogflow CX into NotebookLM.
Secondly, Asking the question: "How does a Dialogflow CX agent interact with data stores to retrieve information?"

  **Answer Generation**:
   - NotebookLM generated a detailed response based on the content within the uploaded document, explaining how Dialogflow CX agents use API integrations and data retrieval protocols to interact with data stores. The generated answer included inline citations that referenced specific sections of the document, ensuring that the response was grounded in the provided source material.

## Results

The generated answer can be accessed [here](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/12d1e3c7-16f0-46d8-a31d-62aa47b88317/qna).

### Key Observations:
- The Q&A feature provided accurate and contextually relevant answers for straightforward, factual questions.
- Inline citations enhanced academic integrity by allowing easy verification of the information.

## Audio Overview Experiment with NotebookLM

### Objective
The goal of this experiment is to test NotebookLM's Audio Overview feature by generating an audio summary of cognitive psychology lecture notes, specifically focusing on theories of memory.

### Steps Taken

1. **Upload Document**: 
   - Uploaded lecture notes titled `BUS5001-Week11-DialogFlowCX-II.pdf` into NotebookLM.
   
2. **Select Audio Overview**:
   - Selected the "Generate Audio Overview" option from NotebookLM's interface.
   
3. **Customize Prompt**:
   - Customized the prompt to focus on "Explain the theories of memory" to generate a targeted audio summary on this topic.
   
4. **Audio Generation**:
   - NotebookLM generated a podcast-style audio summary that highlighted key theories such as short-term memory, long-term memory, and working memory.

5. **Listen and Review**:
   - Listened to the generated audio summary. The audio was clear and concise, covering essential points about memory theories.

### Results

The generated audio file can be accessed [here](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/12d1e3c7-16f0-46d8-a31d-62aa47b88317/audio).
